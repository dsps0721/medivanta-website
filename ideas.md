  **Design Movement**: **Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) meets Modern Medical Cleanliness**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Clarity & Precision**: Information is presented with absolute clarity, reflecting medical accuracy.
  2. **Grid-Based Order**: A strong, visible or invisible grid structure that conveys reliability and trust.
  3. **Human-Centric Warmth**: Balancing clinical sterility with warm photography and soft accent colors to feel approachable.
  4. **Content-First**: Typography is the primary design element, guiding the user through the narrative.

  **Color Philosophy**: 
  - **Primary**: Deep Medical Blue (#0F4C81) - Trust, professional, established.
  - **Secondary**: Soft Sage Green (#88B04B) - Growth, health, vitality.
  - **Background**: Off-white/Alabaster (#F8F9FA) instead of pure white to reduce eye strain and add warmth.
  - **Accent**: Coral (#FF6F61) for call-to-actions, adding a human touch.
  *Reasoning*: Moving away from the cold, sterile blue/white typical of medical sites. The sage and coral add a layer of holistic care and human connection.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Asymmetric Split Screen & Modular Cards**.
  - Instead of a centered hero, use a split layout: strong typography on the left, immersive imagery on the right.
  - Content sections use modular cards that overlap slightly to create depth and connection between services.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Plus Sign Motif**: A subtle, stylized "+" symbol used as a background pattern or section divider.
  - **Frosted Glass Cards**: Content overlays with a slight blur (backdrop-filter) to sit elegantly on top of imagery.
  - **Clean Lines**: Thin, precise lines separating content sections.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Reassuring Stability**.
  - Hover effects are subtle (slight lift, color shift) rather than bouncy or aggressive.
  - Transitions are smooth fades and slides, mimicking a calm breath.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements slide in gently from the bottom with a staggered delay.
  - **Scroll**: Parallax effect on background images to create a sense of depth without dizziness.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Manrope** (Modern, geometric sans-serif with semi-rounded terminals) - Friendly yet professional.
  - **Body**: **Inter** (Clean, highly legible) - Ensuring readability for dense medical information.
  - **Hierarchy**: Large, bold headings contrasted with spacious, light-weight body text.

  **Design Movement**: **Neumorphism (Soft UI) 2.0**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Tactile Realism**: Elements look like they can be touched, pressed, or toggled.
  2. **Soft Shadows**: Using light and shadow to define hierarchy instead of borders.
  3. **Minimalist Focus**: Removing visual clutter to focus entirely on the function.
  4. **Fluidity**: Everything feels connected, like a single continuous surface.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Light Grey-Blue (#E0E5EC) - The canvas for shadows to play on.
  - **Highlights**: Pure White (#FFFFFF) - To create the "raised" effect.
  - **Shadows**: Darker Grey-Blue (#A3B1C6) - To create depth.
  - **Accent**: Vibrant Teal (#00BFA5) - For active states and primary actions.
  *Reasoning*: Creates a sense of high-tech innovation and comfort. It feels like a premium medical device interface.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Centralized Dashboard Aesthetic**.
  - Even for a landing page, the layout feels like a dashboard.
  - "Floating" sections that appear to levitate above the background.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Soft Extruded Buttons**: Buttons that look like physical keys.
  - **Inset Input Fields**: Search bars and forms that look pressed into the surface.
  - **Rounded Corners**: Everything is heavily rounded (20px+) to feel safe and organic.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Tactile Feedback**.
  - Buttons appear to "press down" when clicked.
  - Toggles slide with a satisfying physics-based motion.

  **Animation**:
  - **Micro-interactions**: Focus on the button press, the toggle slide, the card lift.
  - **State Changes**: Smooth morphing between shapes.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Nunito** (Rounded sans-serif) - Complements the soft UI shapes.
  - **Body**: **Lato** (Humanist sans-serif) - Warm and readable.

  **Design Movement**: **Biophilic Design / Organic Tech**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Nature-Inspired Forms**: Using organic curves and shapes instead of rigid boxes.
  2. **Flow & Continuity**: Sections flow into each other like a river, no hard stops.
  3. **Vitality**: Imagery focuses on life, movement, and health, not just doctors in coats.
  4. **Transparency**: Using layers and opacity to create a sense of openness.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Forest Green (#2E8B57) - Deep, grounding, natural.
  - **Secondary**: Sky Blue (#87CEEB) - Openness, air, clarity.
  - **Background**: Warm Beige/Sand (#F5F5DC) - Natural, earthy base.
  - **Accent**: Sun Yellow (#FFD700) - Energy, optimism.
  *Reasoning*: Positioning Medivanta as a source of life and natural health, differentiating from the "clinical blue" competitors.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Fluid/Wave Layout**.
  - Section dividers are curved waves (SVG separators).
  - Content follows a meandering path down the page, guiding the eye naturally.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Organic Blobs**: Background shapes that morph slowly.
  - **Leaf/Cell Patterns**: Subtle background textures inspired by biology.
  - **Masked Imagery**: Images cropped into organic shapes (circles, ovals, blobs).

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Organic Flow**.
  - Scrolling feels like floating downstream.
  - Elements react to mouse movement with a liquid-like delay.

  **Animation**:
  - **Background**: Slow, ambient movement of organic shapes.
  - **Scroll**: Elements fade in and float up as if rising to the surface.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Merriweather** (Serif) - Adds a touch of traditional reliability and organic feel.
  - **Body**: **Open Sans** (Neutral sans-serif) - clean and modern to balance the serif headings.
